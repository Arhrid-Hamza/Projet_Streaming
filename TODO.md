# TODO: Make CSS Look Like Netflix

## Tasks
- [ ] Update wwwroot/css/site.css to enforce pure black (#000000) background, red (#e50914) accents, enhance navbar styling, improve responsiveness, and ensure all elements (tables, forms, cards, links) match the black/red theme.
- [ ] Edit Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml to simplify navbar to Netflix style: logo on left, horizontal menu items (Home, Films, Series, Categories, Genres, Users, Content, Business), search icon, and profile icon on right. Remove dropdowns for cleaner look. Make it fully responsive.
- [ ] Review and tweak Views/Home/Index.cshtml if needed for better photo display in carousels (e.g., adjust image sizes, overlays for Netflix-like appearance).
- [ ] Test responsiveness and overall Netflix-like appearance.
